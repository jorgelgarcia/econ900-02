	abstract = {Empirical researchers often combine multiple instruments for a single treatment using two stage least squares (2SLS). When treatment effects are heterogeneous, a common justification for including multiple instruments is that the 2SLS estimand can still be interpreted as a positivelyweighted average of local average treatment effects (LATEs). This justification requires the wellknown monotonicity condition. However, we show that with more than one instrument, this condition can only be satisfied if choice behavior is effectively homogenous. Based on this finding, we consider the use of multiple instruments under a weaker, partial monotonicity condition. This condition is implied by standard choice theory and allows for richer heterogeneity. First, we show that the weaker partial monotonicity condition can still suffice for the 2SLS estimand to be a positively-weighted average of LATEs. We characterize a simple sufficient and necessary condition that empirical researchers can check to ensure positive weights. Second, we develop a general method for using multiple instruments to identify a wide range of causal parameters other than LATEs. The method allows researchers to combine multiple instruments to obtain more informative empirical conclusions than one would obtain by using each instrument separately.},

Unordered monotonicity implies and is implied by additive separability of choice of treatment equations in terms of observed and unobserved variables. These results follow from properties of binary matrices developed in this paper. We investigate conditions under which unordered monotonicity arises as a consequence of choice behavior. We characterize IV estimators of counterfactuals as solutions to discrete mixture problems.},

We propose an alternative estimator that is free of contamination, and illustrate the shortcomings of two-way ﬁxed effects regression with leads and lags in comparison to our proposed estimator through an empirical application.},

	abstract = {A broad empirical literature uses “event study” research designs for treatment eﬀect estimation, a setting in which all units in the panel receive treatment but at random times. We make four novel points about identiﬁcation and estimation of causal eﬀects in this setting and show their practical relevance. First, we show that in the presence of unit and time ﬁxed eﬀects, it is impossible to identify the linear component of the path of pre-trends and dynamic treatment eﬀects. Second, we propose graphical and statistical tests for pre-trends. Third, we consider commonly-used “static” regressions, with a treatment dummy instead of a full set of leads and lags around the treatment event, and we show that OLS does not recover a reasonable weighted average of the treatment eﬀects: long-run eﬀects are weighted negatively, and we introduce diﬀerent estimators robust to this issue. Fourth, we show that equivalent problems of under-identiﬁcation and negative weighting arise in diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences settings when the control group is allowed to be on a diﬀerent time trend or in the presence of unit-speciﬁc time trends.},

We take a design perspective where we investigate the properties of estimators and procedures given assumptions on the assignment process. We show that under random assignment of the adoption date the standard Difference-In-Differences estimator is an unbiased estimator of a particular weighted average causal effect. We characterize the properties of this estimand, and show that the standard variance estimator is conservative.},
